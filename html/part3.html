                The War.
            </h1>

            <p class="main--section-part1-p">
                As political events gathered momentum, the stage was set for a clash between the Pakistan Army and the
                insurgents. Though smaller Maoist style paramilitary bands started emerging, the Mukti Bahini (freedom
                fighters) emerged increasingly visible. Headed by Colonel Muhammad Ataul Gani Osmani, a retired Pakistan
                Army officer, this band was raised as Mujib's action arm and security force before assuming the
                character of a conventional guerrilla force. After the declaration of Independence, the Pakistan
                military sought to quell them, but increasing numbers of Bengali soldiers defected to the underground
                "Bangladesh army." These Bengali units slowly merged into the Mukti Bahini and bolstered their weaponry.
                They then jointly launched operations against the Pakistan Army killing many in the process. This
                setback prompted the Pakistan Army to induct Razakars, a paramilitary force, from the local populace to
                bolster their numbers. These people were essentially viewed as traitors and with suspicion by local
                Bengalis, as a vast majority of these recruits were Bihari Muslims who had settled during the time of
                partition. This helped Pakistan stem the tide somewhat as the monsoon approached in the months of June
                and July.
            </p>

            <p class="main--section-part1-p">
                Undeterred by this setback, Mukti Bahini regrouped as they gained in strength and capability. Aided by
                the Indian government in West Bengal, they were equipped and trained to counter the Pakistan Army. As
                there was no action during the monsoon, it was seen by the Pakistan military brass as a weakening of the
                Bangladesh cause. However it was merely the lull before the storm. After sensing the enormity of the
                issue, the army was beefed up as the troop strength was increased to more than 80,000. This caused a
                rise in tensions across the border as India realized the gravity of the situation. The Indian military
                were preparing for the eventual onslaught with the aid of the separatists and waited for the end of the
                monsoon season to enable easy passage. The Indians aimed to bypass the villages and towns and instead
                concentrate on the cities and the highways which ultimately would lead to the capture of Dhaka.
            </p>

            <p class="main--section-part1-p">
                Pakistan decided to nullify such an attack and on December 3 and launched a series of preemptive air
                strikes. The attack was modeled on the Operation Focus employed by Israel Air Force during the Six-Day
                War. However the plan failed to achieve the desired success and was seen as an open act of unprovoked
                aggression by the Indians. Indira Gandhi then ordered the immediate mobilization of troops and launched
                the full scale invasion. This marked the official start of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 with fighting
                commencing in West Pakistan. The Indian Army, far superior in numbers and equipment to that of Pakistan,
                executed a three-pronged pincer movement on Dhaka launched from the Indian states of West Bengal, Assam,
                and Tripura. In all these places the Mukti Bahini and the local Bengalis played a vital role in aiding
                the Indian Army. Many soldiers were ferried in the night by the locals across rivers and valuable
                information on the location and whereabouts of different military strongholds were gleaned. It was
                backed up by the Indian Air Force which achieved near air supremacy towards the end of the war as the
                entire East Pakistan airbase with all the flights were destroyed. The Indian Navy, also annihilated the
                eastern wing of the Pakistan Navy and blockaded the East Pakistan ports, thereby cutting off any escape
                routes for the stranded Pakistani warriors. The fledgling Bangladesh Navy (comprising officers and
                sailors who defected from Pakistan Navy) aided the Indians in the marine warfare, carrying out attacks,
                most notably Operation Jackpot.
            </p>

            <p class="main--section-part1-p">
                Meanwhile, on the ground, nearly three brigades of Mukti Bahini along with the Indian forces fought in a
                conventional formation. This was supplemented by guerrilla style attacks on Pakistanis who were facing
                hostilities on land, air, water in both covert and overt ways. Undeterred, Pakistan tried to fight back
                and boost the sagging morale by incorporating the Special Services Group commandos in sabotage and
                rescue missions. This however could not stop the juggernaut of the invading columns whose speed and
                power were too much to contain for the Pakistan Army. On December 16, within just 12 days, the capital
                Dhaka fell to the Mitro Bahini—the allied forces. Lt. Gen. Niazi surrendered to the combined forces
                headed by its commander Lt. Gen. Jagjit Singh Aurora by signing the Instrument of Surrender at Ramna
                Racecourse, 16:31 Indian Standard Time. Bangladesh became liberated
            </p>

            <p class="main--section-part2-p">
                After Pakistan's surrender late in 1971, people in Bangladesh rejoiced at their liberation. This was
                followed by the need for international acceptance for Bangladesh, as only a few countries recognized the
                new nation. Bangladesh sought admission into the UN, Most members voting in its favor but China vetoed
                recognition, as Pakistan was its key ally. However the United States grudgingly recognized it. To ensure
                a smooth transition, in 1972 the Shimla Agreement was signed between India and Pakistan. The treaty was
                a watershed in the history of the South Asian region as it ensured that Bangladesh would be officially
                recognized by Pakistan and its principal allies in exchange for the return of the Pakistani POWs. As a
                gesture of goodwill, the nearly 200 soldiers who were wanted for war crimes by Bengalis were also
                pardoned by India. The accord also gave back more than 13,000 sq. km of land that Indian troops had won
                in West Pakistan during the war, holding on to a few strategic places; most notably Kargil (which would
                in turn again be the focal point for a war between the two nations in 1999). However, the agreement was
                acknowledged by many observers as a sign of India's maturity. Some in India felt that the treaty had
                been too lenient towards Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who had pleaded for more leeway as he felt that the
                fragile democracy in Pakistan would crumble if the accord was perceived as being too harsh in Pakistan.

            <p class="main--section-part2-p">
                14 December, the Martyred Intellectuals’ day. The day we lost the best children of the soil. The most
                grieved day of the Bangali nation. On this day in 1971, when the final victory of the War of Liberation
                was sure to happen, at that very moment the attacking Pakistani forces and their collaborators – the
                Razakars, Al Badr, Al-Shams forces abducted the best and most talented intellectuals of the nation - all
                the academics, researchers, physicians, engineers, journalists, poets and writers were kidnapped,
                blindfolded in the dark of night and then were killed brutally.
            </p>
            <p class="main--section-part2-p">
                The anti-liberation forces realized that their defeat is inescapable. If these best intelligentsias of
                the soil are left alive, they won’t be able to survive in this country. The country will turn into
                prosperity and glory from the ruins of the war. So, they master-planned this conspiracy to make the
                nation talentless and crippled, by killing the most intelligent personals in the most heinous way
                possible.
            </p>
            <p class="main--section-part2-p">
                This massacre of 14th December 1971 was the heinous most barbaric one, which had stunned the
                peace-loving people all around the world. The Pakistani forces and their local collaborators left the
                dead bodies of those intellectuals at many places of Dhaka including Mirpur, Rayer Bazar etc after
                killing them brutally.
            </p>
            <p class="main--section-part2-p">
                Right after achieving the victory on 16th December 1971, the close relatives of the martyred
                intellectuals discovered the melted and mishandled bodies at the Mirpur and Rayer Bazar graveyard. The
                dead bodies carried signs of torture. They were blindfolded and their hands were tied at the back. Some
                of them had more than one bullet shot. Some were killed with sharp weapons. Most of the bodies were too
                distorted that the relatives failed to recognize their beloved ones.
