                The Start.
            </h1>
            <p class="main--section-part1-p">
                Began on 26 March 1971 and ended with the liberation of Bangladesh on 16 December 1971. The armed
                struggle was the culmination of a series of events, situations and issues contributing to the
                progressively deteriorating relations between East and West Pakistan. The questions of land reforms,
                state language, inter-wing economic and administrative disparities, provincial autonomy, the defense of
                East Pakistan and many other consequential questions had been straining the relations between the two
                wings of Pakistan ever since independence of the country from Britain in 1947.
            </p>

            <p class="main--section-part1-p">
                The general elections of 1970 had made Bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman, chief of awami league which
                bagged 167 seats out of 169, the sole spokesman of the people of East Pakistan and majority leader in
                the Pakistan National Assembly. But the Pakistan civil and military ruling clique had refused to
                transfer power to the majority leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his party. Sheikh Mujib also refused to
                yield to the pressure put on him for undue accommodation. Sheikh Mujib's historic address on 7 March
                1971 made this point quite clear to the Pakistani military junta. Then began the civil disobedience
                movement. Meanwhile talks started between Sheikh Mujib and President Yahya Khan to resolve the
                outstanding issues.

            <p class="main--section-part1-p">
                The Pakistan Army was ordered to launch operation on Bangali people at midnight of 25 March. According
                to the plan for operation Search Light two headquarters were established. Major General Rao Farman Ali
                with 57 Brigade under Brigedier Arbab was responsible for operation in Dhaka city and its suburbs while
                Major General Khadim Raja was given the responsibility of the rest of the province. Lieutenant General
                Tikka Khan assumed the overall charge of the operation.

            <p class="main--section-part1-p">
                The ruthless and brutal armed operation undertaken by the Pakistan army on 25 March 1971 in order to
                curb the movement of the freedom loving Bangalis against the autocratic rule of the Pakistani rulers. It
                was termed as 'Operation Searchlight' by the military authority. The purpose of this operation was to
                arrest or kill the distinguished Awami League leaders, student leaders and Bangali intellectuals in the
                main cities of the then East Pakistan including Dhaka, to disarm the Bangali personnels of military,
                para military and police forces and to capture armoury, radio station and telephone exchange, thereby to
                take over the control of the province of East Pakistan by ruthlessly curbing the non-cooperation
                movement headed by Bangabandhu sheikh mujibur rahman. Military operations were being taken under
                'Operation Searchlight' on and from 11-30 pm of 25 March to middle of May in all the big towns of the
                province.
            </p>
            <p class="main--section-part1-p">The Operation Searchlight was scheduled to be launched at 13 hours of 26
                March. But in the evening of 25 March the Awami League chief Sheikh Mujibur Rahman having no positive
                and tangeable result in his discussion with President Yahya Khan had a clarian call to the people to
                prepare themselves for an all out struggle. On that very night freedom loving Bangalis created
                resistance in various places in Dhaka. Major Siddique Salek, the public relation officer of Lt General
                Tikka Khan and AAK Niazi commented that before the Bangalis could create strong resistance the Pakistan
                forces in order to reach various places of Dhaka changed the schedule of the operation one day ahead i.e
                at 11-30 pm of 25 March. But in a White Paper published on 5 August by the Government of Pakistan, it
                has been mentioned that Awami League had a plan to stage an armed revolution at dawn of 26 March. This
                information in the white paper may be a contributory factor for bringing the operation ahead by one day.
            </p>
            <p class="main--section-part1-p">
                The Pakistani soldiers came out of the cantonment at 11-30 pm, launched indiscriminate attack on the
                demonstrating Bangalis in the Farm Gate area, and thus initiated the Operation Searchlight. Then as per
                schedule they launched simultaneous attack on Peelkhana and Rajarbagh. At 1-30 am they arrested
                Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from his residence. At dead of night they launched operation at the
                residential quarters of the teachers of Dhaka University including the then Iqbal Hall, Jagannath Hall,
                Rokeya Hall and killed a huge number of students including nine teachers. Under the same planning,
                serious attack was made on old Dhaka, Tejgaon, Indira Road, Mirpur, Mohammadpur, Dhaka airport,
                Ganaktuli, Dhanmondi, Kalabagan, Kathalbagan etc. In the same night many people were killed and injured
                in Chittagong by the firing of the army. The Pak army launched indiscriminate attack and created havoc
                within the very month of March under the 'Operation Searchlight' having their post at the cantonment.
                The offices of the dailies like the Ittefaq, Sangbad and the Peoples were set on fire for their support
                to the movement of the Bangalis. A good number of journalists, media personnels were burnt to death.
            </p>
            <p class="main--section-part1-p">
                On the eve of the genocide on 25 March, President Yahya Khan left Dhaka for Karachi. But Zulfiqar Ali
                Bhutto, the president of the Pakistan People's Party, who came to Dhaka for having a dialogue with
                Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, observed the operation from the Hotel Intercontinental of Dhaka. On the day
                following on the eve of his departure, Bhutto highly appreciated the action of the army on the previous
                night and commented, 'Thanks to God that Pakistan could have been saved'. All the army officials
                including Yahya Khan expressed ovation to the army action. Even in the White Paper published by Pakistan
                Government on the following 5 August, the military operation on 25 March was termed as 'inevitable'.
            </p>
            <p class="main--section-part1-p">
                The accurate figure of casualty under the operation searchlight on the night of 25 March could not be
                estimated. The foreign journalists were compelled to leave the country before the operation of 25 March.
                Because of strong censorship on the newspapers at home nothing substantial could be gathered about the
                operation. From the report of three foreign journalists, Arnold Jetline, Michael Laurent and Simon
                Dring, who remained in hiding at a risk, some news can be gathered about the ruthless brutality of that
                fateful night. From the report of Simon Dring published under the caption Dateline Dacca in the Daily
                Telegraph of 29 March it was revealed that 200 students of Iqbal Hall, teachers and their family members
                numbering 12 in the University residential area were killed on that night. In old Dhaka 700 people were
                burnt to death. Information gathered from various home and foreign sources reveal that on that fateful
                night seven thousand Bangalis were killed in Dhaka city itself.

                Before his arrest, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman called upon his people to resist Pakistani forces
                of occupation in a declaration that read, “This may be my last message, from today Bangladesh is
                independent. I call upon the people of Bangladesh wherever you might be and with whatever you have, to
                resist the army of occupation to the last. Your fight must go on until the last soldier of the Pakistan
                occupation army is expelled from the soil of Bangladesh and final victory is achieved.” This declaration
                of independence marks the beginning of the Bangladesh Liberation War and is observed as Bangladesh
                Independence Day.
            </p>
            <p class="main--section-part1-p">
                The declaration of Bangladesh's independence was proclaimed on 26 March 1971 during the beginning of the
                Bangladesh liberation war, as the Pakistan Army launched military operations against the people of East
                Pakistan. The declaration was issued by "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman" on midnight 26 March, prior to his
                arrest by the Pakistan Army. Mujib's proclamation was relayed to Bengali nationalist
                forces in Chittagong via wireless telegrams. Between 26 and 27 March, Awami League leader M A Hannan and
                MajorZiaur Rahman, the commander of the defecting East Bengal Regiment of the Pakistan Army, broadcast
                the declaration on the Free Bengal Radio Station in Chittagong. Zia's double-announcements, on behalf of
                Mujib, were transmitted by foreign ships in Chittagong Port to international media outlets around the
                world, as news of Bangladesh's independence spread across the globe.
            </p>
            <p class="main--section-part1-p">
                The violence unleashed by the Pakistani forces on 25 March 1971 proved the last straw to the efforts to
                negotiate a settlement. Following these outrages, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman signed an official declaration
                that read:<br>
                "Today Bangladesh is a sovereign and independent country. On Thursday night, West Pakistani armed forces
                suddenly attacked the police barracks at Razarbagh and the EPR headquarters at Pilkhana in Dhaka. Many
                innocent and unarmed have been killed in Dhaka city and other places of Bangladesh. Violent clashes
                between E.P.R. and Police on the one hand and the armed forces of Pakistan on the other, are going on.
                The Bengalis are fighting the enemy with great courage for an independent Bangladesh. May Allah aid us
                in our fight for freedom. Joy Bangla!""
