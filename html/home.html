            <p class="main--section-part1-p">
                In August 1947 British India was partitioned, ending three hundred years of colonial rule with the
                creation two independent nations: India
                and Pakistan (comprising West and East Pakistan, present-day Bangladesh). From the tumultuous and tragic
                set of events that encompass this
                ‘Great’ and ‘Long’ Partition, much is set in stone: partition caused the ‘greatest mass movement of
                humanity in history’.
            </p>

            <p class="main--section-part1-p">
                Twelve million refugees moved across new national borders drawn up by the British barrister Sir Cyril
                Radcliffe (who had famously never
                travelled further east than Paris before being tasked with drawing up the lines of partition). Crudely,
                this was a division based upon
                religious affiliation, with the creation of a Muslim majority in West and East Pakistan and a Hindu
                majority in India. Between 500,000 and
                2 million souls perished as a result of the ensuing upheaval and violence. 80,000 women were abducted.
                India and Pakistan have since fought
                three wars over disputed boundaries in Kashmir (1947, 1965, and 1999).

            <p class="main--section-part1-p">
                In the long term, Partition has meant an ‘enduring rivalry’ between two nuclear-armed nations and
                continues to define the tone and character
                of Indian and Pakistani politics to this day. This resource takes just one approach to investigating
                Partition by analysing the role of a
                key individual at the heart of the high politics of Partition.</p>

            <p class="main--section-part1-p">
                On 2 June 1947, the last Viceroy of India, Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, announced that Britain had
                accepted that the country should be
                divided into a mainly Hindu India and a mainly Muslim Pakistan, encompassing the geographically separate
                territories of West Pakistan
                (now Pakistan) and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).
                The 'Princely States of India', not directly ruled by the British, were given a choice of which country
                to join. Those states whose princes
                failed to join either country or chose a country at odds with their majority religion, such as Kashmir
                and Hyderabad, became the focus of
                bitter dispute.

            <p class="main--section-part1-p">
                India and Pakistan’s independence at midnight on 14-15 August 1947 was a key moment in the history of
                the British Empire.
                India had been its cornerstone and many colonies had been secured in order to protect the trade routes
                to it. What's more, the British
                withdrawal was clearly seen as a precedent by other parts of the Empire. This hastened their own calls
                for independence.

            <p class="main--section-part2-p">
                Language Movement began in 1948 and reached its climax in the killing of 21 February 1952, and ended in
                the adoption of Bangla as one of
                the state languages of Pakistan. The question as to what would be the state language of Pakistan was
                raised immediately after its creation.
                The central leaders and the Urdu-speaking intellectuals of Pakistan declared that urdu would be the
                state language of Pakistan, just as
                Hindi was the state language of India. The students and intellectuals of East Pakistan, however,
                demanded that Bangla be made one of the
                state languages. After a lot of controversy over the language issue, the final demand from East Pakistan
                was that Bangla must be the
                official language and the medium of instruction in East Pakistan and for the central government it would
                be one of the state languages
                along with Urdu. The first movement on this issue was mobilised by Tamaddun Majlish headed by Professor
                Abul Kashem. Gradually many other
                non-communal and progressive organisations joined the movement, which finally turned into a mass
                movement.
